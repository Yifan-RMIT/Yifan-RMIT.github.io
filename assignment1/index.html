  <h1>The review  of "MYOUNGAE KIM"</h1>

  <h2>1 、What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h1>
  <p>
    At first glance, the webpage feels a bit puzzling—why is there so much blank space on the left? But that very emptiness catches the eye and draws users in. The overall design is clean and minimal, while the text itself is rich and detailed, encouraging readers to focus on the content. Meanwhile, the interactive elements on the right are well-executed, offering a dynamic and engaging experience. Clear dividing lines help organize the layout, making the page easy to navigate and visually appealing.

<h2>2、Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h2>
<p>The website is organized into two main sections. On the left, users can click on individual grid cells to explore their contents. On the right, they can open the portfolio to dive deeper into the concepts behind each project.</p>
  </p>
  <h3>Interacting with the Left Side:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Click on any grid square to see what’s inside—some reveal different patterns or visuals.
    </li>
    <li>Click on the square labeled “5,” then select the text “Merry Christmas.” The background will turn red.
    </li>
    <li>Keep clicking “Merry Christmas” to toggle the background color between red and white.
    </li>
    <li>You can also move the patterns out of the grid and rearrange them freely on the page.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Interacting with the Right Side:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Open different portfolio entries to explore the works in detail.
    </li>
    <li>Scroll down to browse through various projects.
    </li>
    <li>Click “Back list” to return to the main page.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2> 3、What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
  </h2>
<p>
  The most engaging part of the site is the “Merry Christmas” feature within the grid on the left. When activated, the page turns a vivid red, creating a visually striking effect. Combined with black text and Christmas-themed icons, the design evokes a festive, holiday mood that feels warm, cheerful, and inviting.
</p>

<h2>4、What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h2>
<p>Once users open a specific portfolio item on the right, they tend to spend the most time scrolling through the page to explore the detailed content.
</p>

<h2> 5、What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h5>
  <p>The primary aim of this project is to promote a calendar themed around the Christmas countdown. At the same time, the calendar also helps highlight different portfolio pieces, serving as both a creative showcase and a subtle form of advertisement.
  </p>

  <h2>6、How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
  </h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>The choice of theme is spot-on—centering the project around a Christmas countdown instantly evokes the joyful, relaxed feeling people associate with the holiday season. That festive mindset naturally puts users in the mood to explore the site more willingly and attentively.</li>
    <li>The website also features a range of interactive elements, giving users a strong sense of engagement and making the experience feel more personal and fun. The use of red ties in perfectly with the Christmas theme, while the layout and structure are clear and well-organized, keeping the visual experience light and pleasant.
    </li>
    <li>The portfolio itself is fresh, creative, and full of originality. As visitors dive deeper into the content, they often find it surprisingly engaging, which keeps their interest high and encourages further exploration.
    </ul>
  </p>

<h2> 7、What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h2>
<p>I think it’s suitable for repeated use over an extended period—probably around a dozen times—right up until Christmas.

  <h2>8、How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>One advantage of this calendar is its built-in functionality—while browsing the site, users can also keep track of how many days remain until Christmas.</li>
  <li>The interactive grid on the left makes the experience more engaging. Users can move Christmas-themed icons around and place them onto specific calendar dates, making it easy to mark or reference certain days in a fun and intuitive way.</li>
  <li>The theme is particularly well-chosen. Since Christmas is celebrated every year, the calendar has lasting appeal and can be used repeatedly over time.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2> 9、What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h2>
<p>This experience is presented through a digital media format—most notably, the website itself serves as the core platform, along with digital advertisements. However, within this digital context, there are clear influences from non-digital traditions. For instance, the online calendar is modeled after a classic paper calendar, blending traditional concepts with modern digital design.
</p>

<h2>10、What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h2>
<p>When creating interactive experiences, it’s important to think about how to better capture the audience’s attention and encourage active engagement. At the same time, the impact of layout and design on the viewer’s experience shouldn’t be overlooked—clear structure and thoughtful visuals can make a big difference in how users interact with the content.
</p>

<h2>11、 What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?
  </h2>
  <p>When visiting the website, users shouldn’t feel bored or overwhelmed. Instead, they should be immediately drawn in by its thoughtful design—the clean layout and well-balanced color scheme create a visually pleasant experience. As users interact with the site—whether they’re clicking buttons, scrolling through pages, or entering information—the responses should feel smooth and intuitive. Overall, the experience should be both easy to navigate and enjoyable, encouraging users to stay engaged and explore further.
  </p>

  <h2> 12、What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h2>
  <p>The most disappointing part, in my opinion, is the portfolio section on the right. To be honest, the content is difficult to grasp without close attention—the language is somewhat complex, requiring readers to stay highly focused. Additionally, there’s a lack of clear connection between the different portfolio entries. While the layout is neat and structured, the reading experience can feel mentally taxing, making it easy for users to lose interest or struggle to fully understand the material.
  </p>
  <h2>13、What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h2>
  <p>The most satisfying part, for me, was discovering the small icons in the grid on the left. Because they’re not obviously interactive, it’s easy to miss their function. So when I realized they could actually be moved, I felt genuinely happy and excited—it was like stumbling upon a hidden treasure or discovering a new world.
