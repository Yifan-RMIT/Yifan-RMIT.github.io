    <h2>
      1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
      the experience?
    </h2>
    <img src="./红色封面.png" alt="Red Cover" class="red-img" />

    <p>
      At first glance, the webpage feels a bit puzzling—why is there so much
      blank space on the left? But that emptiness draws users in. The design is
      clean and minimal, while the text is rich and detailed, encouraging
      readers to focus on the content. Meanwhile, the interactive elements on
      the right are well-executed, offering a dynamic and engaging experience.
      Clear dividing lines help organize the layout, making the page easy to
      navigate and visually appealing.
    </p>

    <h2>
      2. Spend two minutes with the experience and list each of your discrete
      actions.
    </h2>

    <p>
      The website is divided into two main sections. On the left, users can
      click on individual grid cells to explore their contents. On the right,
      they can open the portfolio to dive deeper into the concepts behind each
      project.
    </p>

    <h3>Interacting with the Left Side:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Click on any grid square to see what’s inside—some reveal different
        patterns or visuals.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click on the square labeled “5,” then select the text “Merry Christmas.”
        The background will turn red.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep clicking “Merry Christmas” to toggle the background color between
        red and white.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can also move the patterns out of the grid and rearrange them freely
        on the page.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interacting with the Right Side:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Open different portfolio entries to explore the works in detail.</li>
      <li>Scroll down to browse through various projects.</li>
      <li>Click “Back list” to return to the main page.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
      3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The most engaging part of the site is the “Merry Christmas” feature within
      the grid on the left. When activated, the page turns a vivid red, creating
      a visually striking effect. Combined with black text and Christmas-themed
      icons, the design evokes a festive, holiday mood that feels warm,
      cheerful, and inviting.
    </p>

    <h2>
      4. What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the
      experience?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Most time was spent scrolling through the portfolio section on the right
      to explore its detailed content.
    </p>

    <h2>
      5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The primary aim of this project is to promote a calendar themed around the
      Christmas countdown. At the same time, the calendar also helps highlight
      different portfolio pieces, serving as both a creative showcase and a
      subtle form of advertisement.
    </p>

    <h2>
      6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Christmas countdown theme creates a joyful, festive atmosphere that
        encourages exploration.
      </li>
      <li>
        Interactive elements make the experience engaging and fun. The use of
        red reinforces the theme, and the clear layout makes browsing easy.
      </li>
      <li>
        The portfolio content is creative and original, keeping users interested
        as they explore further.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
      7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
      over time?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I think it’s suitable for repeated use over an extended period—probably
      around a dozen times—right up until Christmas.
    </p>

    <h2>
      8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
      interacted with over time?
    </h2>
    <p>
      One advantage of this calendar is its built-in functionality—while
      browsing the site, users can also keep track of how many days remain until
      Christmas. The interactive grid on the left makes the experience more
      engaging. Users can move Christmas-themed icons around and place them onto
      specific calendar dates, making it easy to mark or reference certain days
      in a fun and intuitive way. The theme is particularly well-chosen. Since
      Christmas is celebrated every year, the calendar has lasting appeal and
      can be used repeatedly over time.
    </p>

    <h2>
      9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
      reference?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The experience is presented through a digital media format—primarily
      through the website and digital ads. However, it also draws inspiration
      from non-digital traditions, such as classic paper calendars.
    </p>

    <h2>
      10. What does this reference communicate to you about how you should act
      when engaging with the experience?
    </h2>
    <p>
      When creating interactive experiences, it’s important to capture the
      audience’s attention and encourage engagement. Layout and design should be
      clear and thoughtful to enhance the user experience.
    </p>

    <h2>
      11. What does this reference communicate to you about how you should feel
      when engaging with the experience?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Users should feel engaged and interested, not bored or overwhelmed. The
      clear layout and balanced colors create a pleasant browsing experience,
      encouraging further exploration.
    </p>

    <h2>12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction and why?</h2>
    <p>
      The portfolio section on the right is the most frustrating. The content is
      difficult to understand without close attention, and the entries lack
      clear connections. The neat layout doesn't compensate for the mental
      effort required, which may cause users to lose interest.
    </p>

    <h2>13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction and why?</h2>
    <p>
      The most satisfying part was discovering the small icons in the left grid.
      Since they aren’t obviously interactive, realizing they can be moved felt
      like uncovering a hidden feature—almost like finding a secret treasure.
